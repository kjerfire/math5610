## Task 1

Email the link to your repository and table of contents for your completed homework tasks. I understand that this is a very easy task. Make sure that the link is an absolute link. The link should be to the username.github.io repository for the css formatted version.

The Link: [https://kjerfire.github.io/math5610/](https://kjerfire.github.io/math5610/)


## Task 2

Implement a method/routine that computes and returns the absolute error in the approximation of a number x by another number y. Also create an entry for the method in your software manual.



## Task 3

Implement a method/routine that computes and returns the relative error in the approximation of a number x by another number y. Also create an entry for the method in your software manual.


## Task 4

Implement a method that will add two vectors of the same length. Also create an entry for the method in your software manual.

## Task 5

Implement a method that will return a scalar multiple of a given vector. The method should require a vector and number for the operation. Add an entry to your software manual for this method.

## Task 6

Implement a method that will compute the 2-norm of an arbitrary vector will real number entries. Add an entry to your for the method you create.

## Task 7

 Implement a method that will compute the 1-norm of an arbitrary vector will real number entries. Add an entry to your for the method you create.

## Task 8

:Implement a method that will compute the âˆž-norm of an arbitrary vector will real number entries. Add an entry to your for the method you create.

## Task 9

Write a routine that will generate a symmetric matrix that has real values in all entries of the matrix. Add an entry to your for the method you create.


## Task 10

Search the internet for sites that discuss matrix norms. Look for sites that explain induced matrix norms. Write a brief summary of what you find. Limit the discussion to no more than two or three paragraphs and include links to the sites you cite.
