## Task 1

Write a code that will return machine precision for your computer (or any other computer for that matter) in single precision arithmetic. Give the method a name that is descriptive. For example, smaceps(), or something like that. The routine should return the default machine precision in terms of a decimal number. Create a second routine that will return the machine precision in double precision computations. Give the routine a unique name, say dmaceps(). Make sure that your code is fully internally documented with you as the author and so on. An example of a Fortran code is included in this repository. You can translate this into a Python, C, or C++ code to do the work. You can also modify the Fortran and use the given code directly.

- Code:
  - Machine precision in [single precision](routines/smaceps.py).
  - Machine precision in [double precision](routines/maceps.py). 
- Software Manual entries:
  - [single precision](manual/smaceps.md)
  - [double precision](manual/maceps.md)

## Task 2

Create a repository on [Github](https://www.github.com) and create a repositry for this homework. Name the homework repository for your work as follows:

```            username/math5610 ```

Note that your username will be set when you create your Github account. It is important for appropriate grading to name the repository as above.

- GitHub respository: [kjerfire/math5610](https://github.com/kjerfire/math5610)

## Task 3

Create a repository for Github Pages. You can do this by using the documentation at the following link:

 ```          https://pages.github.com/ ```

The information on the web page given above will show you how to build web pages from Jeykll css files. This repository allows access to projects as you create them in your repository. I will use the link created in this repository to grade your Software Manual.

- GitHub Pages: [kjerfire.github.io](https://kjerfire.github.io)

## Task 4

Create a folder in your "math5610" repository for your for your software manual. Download a copy of the  markdown file for your software manual. Put a copy of this file in the folder for the software manual for the codes you write. At this point in the homework, you have two routines that need to be documented in the software manual. These are the single precision and double precision machine epsilon codes from the tasks above.

Note: The software manual must use the template above to be graded!. The theme can be changed to one you like more, but the format should be consistent.

- Software Manual [Directory](https://github.com/kjerfire/math5610/tree/master/manual).

## Task 5

Create a table of contents for the homework tasks using markdown. We will go through the basics of markdown and how to set up a table of contents for your work. Also build a markdown file that will serve as a table of contents for the entries in the software manual.

- Table of Contents for [Homework 1](H1.md).
- Table of Contents for [Software Manual](manual).

## Task 6

To complete this problem, you will need to go to the Engineering Computer Lab on the third floor of the Engineering Building. Login to one of the computers and open up a Cygwin window. A Linux shell window will pop up for you to use. Complete the following steps:

1. Log onto a computer (Engineering Lab) and open a command terminal to work in.

2. Upload/copy the routines that you created in the first problem.

3. Compile the routines into object modules (.o files). For example, put the files you have uploaded into a folder, say hw1_prob3, using the command

   ​     ```% mkdir hw1_prob3```

   and in a Cygwin/Linux/Unix operating system. Note that the "%" is the command prompt that may appear in the command terminal. Then use

   ​     ``` % mv *.f hw1_prob3```
   ​     ```% cd hw1_prob3```

   to move all files ending with a .f suffix to the folder just created and change the working folder to the folder just created. Finally, compile the files using

   ​      ```% gfortran -c *.f```

   or

   ​      ```% gcc -c *.c```

   using the C-compiler in Cygwin. The result will be a bunch of object files with a suffix of ".o".

4. The last step in this problem is to create a shared library from the routines you have created.

   ​      ``` % ar rcv mylib *.o``` 

   or

   ​      ```% ar rcv mylib *.o```
   ​      ```% ranlib mylib.a```

- Shared Library: [math5610lib](mylib.a)

## Task 7

In this problem you will learn a bit more about your computer and how many processes you can run on the cores included in your computer. You will use OpenMP to do this work.

To start, write code like the following.
```
program main
print *, "hello world!"
stop
end
```
to implement the good old Hello World introductory program. Compile and run the code you have created. The code should produce the string in the print statement. That is,
```
hello world!
```
Now, let's do a bit more with this example. We will need to add some code to the example to have each of the cores on your computer write out the same statement. In addition, the way that the code is compiled will also change. That we will do on the other side of the following code.
```
|      program main
|      integer id, nthrds
|      integer omp_get_thread_num, omp_get_num_threads
|C$OMP PARALLEL PRIVATE(id)
|      id = omp_get_thread_num()
|      print *, 'hello world from thread', id
|C$OMP BARRIER
|      if(id .eq. 0) then
|        nthrds = omp_get_num_threads()
|        print *, 'There are', nthrds, ' threads!'
|      end if
|C$OMP END PARALLEL
|      stop
|      end
```
First, there are some things that need to be described in the code:

1. The line on the left indicates how the code needs to be written in the column. In fortran, the comment line must start as the first character of the line typed in. So, the vertical lines are like the edge of the window and is not actually a character on your screen, just the border of the document.

2. The string "C$OMP" tells the compiler that the line is a line associated with OpenMP. The first letter must appear in the first column and indicates that when compiled without OpenMP extensions, will be ignored. If the OpenMP library is available, the compiler will include the parameters contained in the comments. These strings are the start of a "directive" to the compiler to do something.

3. For the present time, (1) save the code above into a file named "hello.f", (2) compile the code above, using

   ``` % gfortran -fopenmp hello.f -o hello```

   and then run the compiled version of the code using the command

    ``` % ./hello.exe```

   Report the results of running the code.
   
 ```$ ./hello.exe
 hello world from thread           7
 hello world from thread           4
 hello world from thread           6
 hello world from thread           0
 hello world from thread           1
 hello world from thread           5
 hello world from thread           3
 hello world from thread           2
 There are           8  threads!
```  
    

## Task 8

Read the three disaster articles at the site

​           [http://www-users.math.umn.edu/~arnold/disasters/disasters.html](http://www-users.math.umn.edu/~arnold/disasters/disasters.html)

Write a brief paragraph on each of the disasters, describing the particular problem as described.

- The first example involved a U.S. Patriot missle system in the middle east. The issue related to a verry small rounding error that accumulated based on the structure of a counting mechanism in the missle defense tracking system. The system measured in tenth of a second increments, which is a non terminating value in binary, and then multiplied that value by 10 to calculate time in seconds. Despite this error being very small in each calculation, after 100 hours it compounded to an error of enough to alter the accuracy of the tracking system by up to 500 meters. In this case the enemy scud missle struck its target killing 28 and wounding many more.

- The second instance discussed is a joint European rocket project that cost $7 billion between many countries. The issue was data indicating horizontal velocity of the rocket. This information was converted from a 64 bit float value to a 16 bit integer. At one point the horizontal velocity exceeded 32,767. This is important, because 32,767 is the maximum value the 16 bit signed integer could take, and thus the code broke, not able to perform the conversion. The breakage in code resulted in the rocket veering off course, then blowing up.

- The third and last disaster involved an offshore oil platform support that failed under stress. Upon investigation, it was found that there was a flaw in the testing process that was used to determine the shear stresses. This flaw resulted in a 47% underestimation of this stress. This miscalculation resulted in a catastrophic failure of the structure and a loss of $700 milion.

## Task 9

Write a routine that will generate a random matrix of a given size. That is, input the number of rows and columns and output the matrix created by setting each entry in the matrix to a random value between zero and one.

Random Matrix Program: [randMat.py](routines/randMat.py)

Software Manual Entry: [randMat Documentation](manual/randMat.md)



## Task 10

Search the Internet for sites that discuss linear algebra packages for solving linear algebra problems. Find a couple of sites that most closely line up with what you think we will be doing in the class. Reference the sites in a brief discussion.

One site, which was more a link to a PDF, I found was a discussion and comparison of a variety of linear solver packages from 1998. In this paper, the author sought out more than a dozen different packages written in various languages and with different capabilities. At one point, the author presents a table comparing the basic features of these packages such as allowance for parallel operation, use of iterative methods, or if the package provides information of flops and timing. The author later goes on to compare different packages on problems accross different machines. I found this interesting because it got me thinking about the possibility that different implementations may outperform others on different machines or computer configurations. This is slightly different to the way I typically view mathematics.
The second site I selected was for scipy, a computational package built on numpy. These both are python implemented open source mathematics packages. One significant thing I learned, was that a good deal of the scipy package is python code that implements time critical processes in C++ or fortran. Specifically routines from netlib were referenced.
