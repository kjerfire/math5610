## Task 1

 Implement a method that returns the absolute error in the approximation of one vector by another when the 2-norm is used. 
 Make sure to add an entry to your software manual to document the work.

## Task 2

 Implement a method that returns the absolute error in the approximation of one vector by another when the 1-norm is used. 
 Add an entry to your software manual that documents the method.
 

## Task 3

Implement a method that returns the absolute error in the approximation of one vector by another when the ∞-norm is used. 
Add an entry to your software manual that documents the method.


## Task 4

Implement a method that returns the 1-matrix norm of a given square matrix. 
Add an entry to your software manual that documents the method.


## Task 5

 Implement a method that returns the ∞-norm of a given square matrix. Add an entry to your software manual that documents the method.
 

## Task 6

 Implement a method that returns the dot produce of two vectors of the same length. 
 Add an entry to your software manual that documents the method.
 


## Task 7

Implement a method that returns the cross-product of two vectors of length three. 
Add an entry to your software manual that documents the method.


## Task 8

 Implement a method that returns the product of two matrices with an equal inner dimension. 
 Add an entry to your software manual that documents the method.


## Task 9

Write a routine that will generate a diagonally dominant matrix that has real values in all entries of the matrix. 
Add an entry to your for the method you create.



## Task 10

Search the internet for sites that define and discuss the Frobenius matrix norm. 
Also, look for sites that define consistent matrix norms. Summarize in a paragraph or two what you found and as usual cite the sites.
